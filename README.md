# jupyter-notebook package

A package that works like the Jupyter Notebook, but inside Atom. It's registered as an opener for `.ipynb` files â€” try opening one!

## Usage

1. Clone
2. `apm install`
3. then install to Atom with `apm link`.

This package will only work if you've started Atom from the command line. Close all your Atom windows, then run `atom <file|dir>` in a terminal.

## Achitecture

This package is built on React and the Flux architecture.

### Map

- **main** tells Atom how to render `NotebookEditor` and registers as an Opener for `.ipynb` files
- **dispatcher** is a singleton flux.Dispatcher which contains the list of valid actions
- **notebook-editor** is the Store and handles all of the business logic. It loads the file in, creates a state, then receives Actions and updates the state accordingly.
- **notebook-editor-view**, notebook-cell, text-editor, display-area are the views. notebook-editor-view updates its state by fetching it from notebook-editor, then passes appropriate bits of that state down to the other views as props.

### Flow

**Rendering:** `NotebookEditor -> NotebookEditorView -> [child views]`

**Updating:** `[external action] -> Dispatcher.dispatch -> NotebookEditor.onAction ?-> NotebookEditor._onChange -> NotebookEditorView._onChange`

### Immutable state

The state returned by `NotebookEditor.getState` is an [`Immutable.js`](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) object.

Accessing its properties inside a view looks like this:

```javascript
let executionCount = this.props.data.get('execution_count');
```

Changing it (in NotebookEditor) looks like this:

```javascript
this.state = this.state.setIn(
    ['cells', cellIndex, 'source'],
    payload.source);
```

or this:

```javascript
outputs = outputs.push(el.outerHTML);
```

Since React requires a view's state to be a regular JS object, the state of NotebookEditorView takes the form:

```javascript
{
    data: <Immutable object>
}
```

No other views have state.

## To do

- make the UI work with other Atom themes (it only looks good the One Light themes now)
- keyboard shortcuts & Atom commands
- add more actions (duplicate cell, restart kernel, change cell type, etc)
- autocomplete
- files saved by this package are not currently loadable by `ipython notebook`
- tell React [our rendering is pure](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.html)
- test rendering performance with big notebooks
